# Network Reconfiguration: Dynamic DNS and TSIG

This repository documents the reconfiguration of a Proxmox-based lab network to simulate a cloud-provider-like environment.  
The first step is enabling **secure Dynamic DNS** using **TSIG keys** for authenticated zone transfers and updates.

---

## 1. Current vs Target Configuration

### Current Setup

- 3-node Proxmox cluster (HP Proliant DL360 Gen8)
- 1 standalone Proxmox node simulating a distant region
- Unmanaged switch, bonded NIC pairs
- IPv4 only

![Current Network](readme_current_network.png)

---

### Target Setup

- Same Proxmox nodes
- Managed switches with VLAN support
- OPNSense router/firewall for VLAN separation and routing
- IPv6 for internal addressing
- Dynamic DNS with TSIG authentication

## 2. Dynamic DNS Setup

### Generate TSIG Keys

````bash
# Zone Transfer Key
tsig-keygen -a hmac-sha512 ddns-transfer-key | sudo tee -a /etc/bind/ddns-signatures 1>/dev/null 2>&1

# Zone Update Key
tsig-keygen -a hmac-sha512 ddns-update-key | sudo tee -a /etc/bind/ddns-signatures 1>/dev/null 2>&1

Set correct ownership and permissions:

```bash
sudo chown root:bind /etc/bind/ddns-signatures
sudo chmod g-w,o-rwx /etc/bind/ddns-signatures
````

Store keys securely in a password manager or Vault.

- Zone transfers → require ddns-transfer-key
- Dynamic updates → require ddns-update-key

---

## 3. Configure BIND

Include the TSIG keys in /etc/bind/named.conf:

```bash
include "/etc/bind/ddns-signatures";
```

Require signed zone transfers:

```bash
allow-transfer {
    192.0.2.10;      # example secondary DNS
    key ddns-transfer-key;
};
```

⚠️ Don’t forget semicolons — missing them is a common error.

Restart BIND:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart named
```

---

## 4. Zone Transfers with dig

Create a shell alias to load credentials without exposing them in history:

```bash
alias set_HMAC='read -i "hmac-sha512 " -ep "Encrypt. Algorithm: " HMAC_ALG; \
read -i "ddns-update-key " -ep "DDNS User: " HMAC_USER; \
read -sep "DDNS Password: " HMAC_PASSWD; \
HMAC=\${HMAC_ALG}:\${HMAC_USER}:\${HMAC_PASSWD}'
```

Exported variable $HMAC can now be used with dig and nsupdate.

Example zone transfer:

```bash
dig @ns1.in.hcinfotech.ch +noall +answer in.hcinfotech.ch -y $HMAC -t AXFR \
| grep -E $'[\t| ](A|CNAME|MX)[\t| ]'
```

Explanation:

- Connects to the primary nameserver for zone in.hcinfotech.ch
- Initiates an authenticated AXFR zone transfer
- Filters for A, CNAME, and MX records

---

## 5. Configure the secondary name servers to use the same key for transfers

Securaly copy file /etc/bind/ddns-signatures to the secondary DNS servers

Add a section indicating the primary name server after the transfer key in file /etc/bind/ddns-signatures

```bash
key "ddns-transfer-key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha512;
    isecret "XXXX";
};
server 192.168.1.20 {   # example ip of primary name server
    keys {
        ddns-transfer-key;
    };
};
```

Key ddns-update-key can be deleted from the file on the secondary.

Restart named on secondary

```bash
sudo systemctl restart named
```

---

## 6. Configure the primaryname server for dynamic updates

Update /etc/bind/named.conf.local on the primary name server and add the following section
to any zone that will be updated dynamically:

```bash
update-policy {
 grant ddns-update-key zonesub ANY;
};
```

AppArmor prevents nmed from updazing files in /etc/bind. The zone file needs to be put into
directoy /var/lib/bind/ in order for it to be updated by named.

Example zone entry in /etc/bind/named.conf.local:

```bash
zone "example.com" IN {
  type primary;
  file "/var/lib/bind/example.com.zone";
  allow-transfer {
    192.168.0.20;    # example secondary name server
  };
  update-policy {
    grant ddns-update-key zonesub ANY;
  };
};
```

Create the initial zone file in /var/lib/bind/. The zone file needs to contain the SOA record,
and the NS records of the name servers. Everything else can be loaded dynamically with nsupdate.

Example initial zone file /var/lib/bind/example.com.zone:

```bash
$TTL 172800     ; 2 days
$ORIGIN example.com.
@                 IN SOA  ns1.example.com. info.example.com. (
                                2025091000 ; serial
                                43200      ; refresh (12 hours)
                                900        ; retry (15 minutes)
                                1814400    ; expire (3 weeks)
                                7200       ; minimum (2 hours)
                                )
;NAME       TTL   CLASS   TYPE    Resource Record
                  IN      NS      ns1.example.com

;Name Servers
ns1               IN      A       192.168.1.20
```

---

## 7. Transfer the currently existing zone to the new dynamic zone

Use dig to create the transfer file, after executing the alias to create the $HMAC variable

```bash
dig @ns1.example.com +noall +answer example.com -y \$HMAC -t AXFR \
| grep -E $'[\t| ](A|CNAME|MX)[\t| ]' > ~/example.com.zone.transfer
```

Add all t^he record types in your zone that need to be transferred. ^Here you can cleanup
the entries in the created file and remove everything that is not needed anymore.

Add "update add " in front of every line. In vim thsi can be done with:

```bash
:%s/^/update add /
```

Add the following two lines as th first two lines of the file

```bash
server ns1.example.com
zone example.com
```

Add the following as the last line of the file:

```bash
send
```

Use nsupdate to create the new zone

```bash
nsupdate -y $HMAC ~/example.com.zone.transfer
```

This updates all of the records of the file into the new zone. It creates a journal file
example.com.zone.jnl in /var/lib/bind and it notifies all the secondary name servers of
the changed zone.

Entries in this zone should only be maintained using ndupdate, as manually changing the zone
file will cause conflicts and inconsistancies.

## 8. Dynamic Updates with nsupdate

### Add a Record

update.txt:

```bash
server ns1.example.com
zone example.com
update add test.example.com. 3600 IN AAAA 2001:db8::1234
send
```

Execute:

```bash
nsupdate -y $HMAC update.txt
```

### Delete a record

update.txt:

```bash
server ns1.example.com
zone example.com
update delete test.example.com. IN AAAA
send
```

Execute:

```bash
nsupdate -y $HMAC update.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
dig @ns1.example.com test.example.com AAAA
```

## 9. Implement a Temporary API based on dnspython to update DNS records

## 10. Security Best Practices

🔑 Key Management

- Rotate keys regularly
- Separate keys for transfer vs update
- Revoke unused keys immediately
- Store keys in Vault or KeePass

🔒 Access Control

- Restrict allow-transfer and allow-update to trusted IPs and keys
- Avoid using shared update keys across clients

🧩 Operational Hardening

- Run named as a non-privileged user
- Restrict key file permissions (640)
- Disable dynamic updates on static zones

📜 Logging and Auditing

- Enable query/update logging in BIND
- Periodically review logs for anomalies
- Optionally integrate with a SIEM

🧪 Testing

- Always validate updates with dig
- Test failure cases (wrong key, expired TTLs, etc.)

## 11. Next Steps

This Dynamic DNS configuration is the foundation for broader reconfiguration:

1. Migrate to IPv6 – replace IPv4 addressing with IPv6
2. Introduce Managed Switches – VLAN support for tenant/service isolation
3. Deploy OPNSense – central routing, firewalling, VLAN separation
4. Adopt SDN principles – prepare for multi-tenant cloud simulation

Each step will be documented in follow-up guides and YouTube walkthroughs.
