# Summary: Building a Hardened DNS Infrastructure

By completing these steps, you now have:

- TSIG-protected zone transfers and updates – preventing unauthorized servers from pulling or injecting data.

- Dynamic DNS support – allowing secure, authenticated updates to zone data.

- DNSSEC signing and validation – providing cryptographic integrity and authenticity for all DNS records.

- Automation for ZSK rollover and re-signing – ensuring ongoing security without manual intervention.

- Hardened configuration – including ACLs, restricted permissions, and monitoring.

This combination represents a production-grade DNS setup that is resilient against spoofing, cache poisoning, and unauthorized changes — while remaining maintainable in the long term.
The next step in your environment could be integrating monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana dashboards) to watch for anomalies, and extending this approach to IPv6-enabled networks and multi-region failover.
