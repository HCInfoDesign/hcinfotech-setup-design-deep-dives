# DNS infrastructure ‚Äì deep dive setup

This series of guides documents the process of rebuilding and securing the DNS infrastructure for the HCInfoTech lab environment.  
The goal is to move from a simple, static configuration to a production-like setup with:

- A properly structured **primary/secondary nameserver** architecture
- **Dynamic DNS updates** and secured **zone transfers** using TSIG
- **DNSSEC signing** with automated key management and re-signing

The series is based on the same principles that a real-world production migration would follow ‚Äî  
minimizing disruption, validating every step, and using automation where possible.

## Network restructuring - current vs. target state

This repository documents the reconfiguration of a Proxmox-based lab network to simulate a cloud-provider-like environment.
The first step comprises enabling secure Dynamic DNS by using TSIG keys for authenticated zone transfers and updates.

### Current setup

- 3-node Proxmox cluster (HP Proliant DL360 Gen8)
- 1 standalone Proxmox node simulating a distant region
- Unmanaged switch, bonded NIC pairs
- IPv4 only

### Target setup

- Same Proxmox nodes
- Managed switches with VLAN support
- OPNSense router/firewall for VLAN separation and routing
- IPv6 for internal addressing
- Dynamic DNS with TSIG authentication

## üåê Current vs. target architecture

![Current state](../common/images/current-internal-dns-topology.png)
**Current State:**  
_A simple single-zone setup with unencrypted transfers and static zone files._

![Target state](../common/images/target-internal-dns-topology.png)
**Target State:**  
_A secure, automated DNS infrastructure with TSIG-protected zone transfers, dynamic updates, and DNSSEC._

## üìë Guides

- **[Part 1. New DNS Installation](./1.%20New%20DNS%20Infrastructure/README.md)**
  Installation of BIND9 on Ubuntu 25.04, configuration of primary and secondary nameservers, ACLs, forwarders, and base zone setup.

- **[Part 2. Dynamic DNS & TSIG](./2.%20Add%20DDNS%20to%20current%20setup/README.md)**  
  Securing zone transfers and updates using TSIG, enabling dynamic DNS updates, and validating secure zone replication.

- **[Part 3. DNSSEC Setup & Automation](./3.%20DNSSEC%20Configuration/README.md)**  
  Enabling DNSSEC, signing zones, publishing DS records, and automating ZSK rollover and re-signing.

## üéØ Purpose

This exercise is part of a larger network reconfiguration project to simulate a production-grade environment  
with IPv6 support, VLAN isolation, and automated infrastructure management.  
By following this series, you can replicate a secure and maintainable DNS setup in your own lab.
